*Unibg Security Lab* is the Computer Security Team at Universit√† degli Studi di
Bergamo.

Its work focuses on several areas in computer science such as systems security
(UNIX/Linux security), mobile security (especially Android security and malware
analysis), information systems, database technology (data warehouses, workflow
management systems), Web, emerging technologies and information security
(security for databases, access control, secure reputation in P2P networks, data
outsourcing and privacy).

The team is often involved in european projects, and is currently working on
ensuring proper protection of private/ sensitive/confidential information with
the GLACIATION project. The recent work on Android security allowed the team to
