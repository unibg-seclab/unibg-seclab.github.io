  abstract={The support for Mandatory Access Control offered by SELinux has become a significant component of the security design of the Android operating system, offering robust protection and the ability to support system-level policies enforced by all the elements of the system. A well-known security-sensitive aspect of Android that currently SELinux does not cover is the abuse of intents, which represent the Android approach to inter-process communication. We propose SEIntentFirewall, an SELinux intent manager that provides fine-grained access control over Intent objects, permitting to cover within MAC policies the use of intents.},
