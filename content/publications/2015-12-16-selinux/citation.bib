abstract="Solutions like SELinux have recently regenerated interest toward Mandatory Access Control (MAC) models. The role of MAC models can be expected to increase in modern systems, which are exposed to significant threats and manage high-value resources, due to the stronger protection they are able to offer. Android is a significant representative of these novel systems and the integration of MAC models is an important recent development in its security architecture. Opportunities indeed exist to further enrich the support offered by MAC models, increasing their flexibility and integrating them with other components of the system. We discuss a number of proposals that have recently been made in this domain.",
