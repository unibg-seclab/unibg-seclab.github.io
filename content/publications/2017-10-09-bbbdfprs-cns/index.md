The protection of content confidentiality as well as of
access and pattern confidentiality of data moved to the cloud have
been recently the subject of several investigations. The distributed
shuffle index addresses these issues by randomly partitioning
data among three independent cloud providers. In this paper, we
describe the implementation of the distributed shuffle index in
the high-performance Dell EMC platform. We first illustrate the
main characteristics of the industry testbed and then show the
results of our experiments, confirming the limited performance
overhead and the practical applicability of the distributed shuffle
index in industrial environments.
