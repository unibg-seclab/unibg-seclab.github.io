Decentralized Cloud Storage (DCS) networks represent
an interesting solution for data storage and management.
DCS networks rely on the voluntary effort of a considerable
number of (possibly untrusted) nodes, which may dynamically
join and leave the network at any time. To profitably rely on
DCS for data storage, data owners therefore need solutions that
guarantee confidentiality and availability of their data. In this
paper, we present an approach enabling data owners to keep
data confidentiality and availability under control, limiting the
owners intervention with corrective actions when availability or
confidentiality is at risk. Our approach is based on the combined
adoption of AONT (All-Or-Nothing-Transform) and fountain
codes. It provides confidentiality of outsourced data also against
malicious coalitions of nodes, and guarantees data availability
even in case of node failures. Our experimental evaluation clearly
shows the benefits of using fountain codes with respect to other
approaches adopted by current DCS networks.
