Cloud storage services offer a variety of benefits that make
them extremely attractive for the management of large amounts of data.
These services, however, raise some concerns related to the proper protection
of data that, being stored on servers of third party cloud providers,
are no more under the data owner control. The research and development
community has addressed these concerns by proposing solutions where
encryption is adopted not only for protecting data but also for regulating
accesses. Depending on the trust assumption on the cloud provider
offering the storage service, encryption can be applied at the server side,
client side, or through an hybrid approach. The goal of this chapter is to
survey these encryption-based solutions and to provide a description of
some representative systems that adopt such solutions.
