The distributed shuffle index strengthens the guarantees
of access confidentiality provided by the shuffle index
through the distribution of data among three cloud providers.
In this paper, we analyze architectural and design issues and
describe an implementation of the distributed shuffle index
integrated with different cloud providers (i.e., Amazon S3,
OpenStack Swift, Google Cloud Storage, and EMC Elastic
Cloud Storage). The experimental results obtained with our
implementation confirm the protection guarantees provided
by the distributed shuffle index and its limited performance
overhead, demonstrating its practical applicability in cloud
scenarios.
