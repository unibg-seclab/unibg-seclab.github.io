Decentralized Cloud Storage services represent a
promising opportunity for a different cloud market, meeting the
supply and demand for IT resources of an extensive community
of users. The dynamic and independent nature of the resulting
infrastructure introduces security concerns that can represent a
slowing factor towards the realization of such an opportunity,
otherwise clearly appealing and promising for the expected
economic benefits. In this paper, we present an approach enabling
resource owners to effectively protect and securely delete their
resources while relying on decentralized cloud services for their
storage. Our solution combines All-Or-Nothing-Transform for
strong resource protection, and carefully designed strategies
for slicing resources and for their decentralized allocation in
the storage network. We address both availability and security
guarantees, jointly considering them in our model and enabling
resource owners to control their setting
